# Zuber Ride-Sharing Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes ride-sharing data in Chicago to uncover passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. We use three datasets to gain insights into cab company performance, popular drop-off locations, and examine the effect of weather on ride durations.

## Datasets
- **Taxi rides data:**
  - Information on ride frequency and cab company performance.
  
- **Neighborhood data:**
  - Data on various neighborhoods where rides end.
  
- **Weather data:**
  - Weather conditions during ride times, focused on November 2017.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Import and Cleaning:**
   - Imported and cleaned all datasets, ensuring correct data types for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Identified top-performing drop-off locations with Loop being the most requested.
   - Flash Cab emerged as the most popular cab company.

3. **Hypothesis Testing:**
   - Tested the hypothesis that ride durations vary on rainy Saturdays using a t-test.
   - The test showed a significant difference in ride durations under different weather conditions.

## Results
- Loop is the top drop-off location.
- Flash Cab ranks as the leading cab company.
- Weather significantly influences ride duration on Saturdays, especially during rain.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides Zuber with valuable insights into ride patterns and influences, highlighting opportunities to optimize services based on customer preferences and external factors.

## Future Work
- Further segmentation of data by time of day or passenger demographics.
- Investigating additional weather patterns and their impact on rides.
